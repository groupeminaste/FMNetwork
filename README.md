# FMNetwork

FMobile Developer Pack v5. The power of FMobile's latest engine, FMNetwork, in a simple Swift Package.

### Important information: FMobile 5 and FMNetwork lost a lot of its features due to changes in iOS 15.2. Starting with iOS 16.0, Apple has also deprecated the CTCarrier object from the Core Telephony API, and building FMobile 5 using iOS 16.4+ as a target (SDK) will make FMobile and FMNetwork entirely unusable as all the values returned by the APIs will be generic.

## Installation

Add `https://github.com/GroupeMINASTE/FMNetwork.swift.git` to your Swift Package configuration (or using the Xcode menu: `File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency`)

## Usage

```swift
// Import the package
import CoreTelephony
import FMNetwork

// Create a variable and intitialize FMNetwork with the SIM card type you want.
// You can use .current, .sim, or .esim.
// Keep in mind that if you use .current, the SIM card type that will be returned in the card.type property is very likely to change to .sim or .esim accordingly.
let current = FMNetwork(.current)
let sim = FMNetwork(.sim)
let esim = FMNetwork(.esim)

// Then access the properies you want.
// The FMNetwork class is composed of two properties : card and network, giving you data about the SIM card itself and its connected network. For example:
if current.card.mcc == current.network.mcc {
    print("The card is in its home country!")
}

// If you want to access the complementary data provided by the official FMobile API service, you need to initiate the fmobile property. It is equal to nil by default, and needs to be initialized manually using the loadFMobileService() function after the FMNetwork object got initialized. The function is working in async, and requires an active Internet connection to work properly. The status property recieved by a completionHandler is a Bool indicating whether the retrieve of the data was successful or not. You are fully responsible of the mobile data consumed by this function.
current.loadFMobileService { (status) in
    if status {
        print(current.fmobile?.mcc)
    }
}

// You can also access some device properties, like the airplane mode status.
if current.device.isOnAirplaneMode {
    print("The device is on airplane mode!")
}

// Or you can access data about the connected Wi-Fi network.
// The device property is not depending on any mobile network, which means you can call it from any FMNetwork object, including the SIM and eSIM.
if let network = current.device.currentWifiNetwork {
    print("The device is connected to the " + network.ssid + " network.")
} else {
    print("The device is not connected to Wi-Fi, or the app does not meet the requirements.")
}

// To access the full documentation, you can use the Quick Help feature in Xcode. Simply Command + click on any item of FMNetwork you wrote (for example the first mcc), and click on Show Quick Help to view the entire documentation for that part of the code.
```
